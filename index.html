<div class="bg-dark text-light col-6 ">Americano: <br>
    A coffee drink typically made from equal parts espresso and hot water and is enjoyed 
    black or with a small amount of cream. Americanos typically have strong flavor with less bitterness.</div>
<div class="bg-dark text-light col-3 ">Iced Coffee: <br>

    <div class="bg-secondary col-4  text-light">Mocha:<br>
        A coffee drink known for its chocolatey sweet, rich, and indulgent flavor. Mocha is made with steamed milk, chocolate syrup, and espresso with
         a layer of foam added to the top. This coffee beverage can be enjoyed hot or cold. </div>
    <div class="bg-primary col-4 text-light">Long Macchiato:<br>
        Long macchiato is similar to how a traditional macchiato is prepared but with a double espresso instead of a single shot. This coffee drink is made with double espresso and a small amount of steamed milk on top.
         A long macchiato is typically a stronger coffee with a small amount of creamy texture.</div>
